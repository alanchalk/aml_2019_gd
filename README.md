# AML_2019 Coursework, Part 1, Group x
Experiments with Gradient Descent
---

I can use github markdown
|![fn_loss](https://github.com/alanchalk/aml_2019_gd/blob/master/images/04a_loss_function.png)|
|:---:|
|A function with multiple local minima.  It does not have valleys or saddle points.|

Or I can use html

</p>

## Introduction
This is what this project is about

## A section

## Another section
Now we discuss and illustrate the function.  We might include some links or references, like [how to style your README.md file](https://sindresorhus.com/github-markdown-css/)

## Experiments
